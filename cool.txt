Thanks for using Calcsys!


1) Enable Lowercase (no TI-73)
-First, goto the System Flags section of Calcsys
-Press Next (6) seven times, so that groups 23-27 are on the screen
-Choose group get/send (2)
-Press 3 (so that there is a 1 to the right of "lower case")
-Lowercase is now enabled (press alpha twice to type in lower case)
-You can now type in lowercase in TIOS!

2) Display Calcsys in Inverted Text
-First, goto the System Flags section of Calcsys
-Press Next (6) once, so that groups 5-9 are on the screen
-Choose group text (1)
-Press 3 so that a 1 is shown to the right of "textinverse"
-Calcsys is now displayed in white on black, instead of black on white!

3) Protect or Unprotect a Program
-First, goto the VAT section of Calcsys
-Choose the "Prog/List VAT" (1) option
-Navigate through the variable lists until your program is on screen
-Choose the program you want to protect or unprotect (1-5)
-Press Alpha+P
-If the program was unprotected, it will now be protected!
-If the program was protected, it will now be unprotected!

4) Change the Name of a Program
(note: you can not change the length of the name with this method
Changing the length of a name is a much more complicated process)
-First, goto the VAT section of Calcsys
-Choose the "Prog/List VAT" (1) option
-Navigate through the variable lists until the program is on screen
-Choose the program you want to change the name of (1-5)
-Press Alpha+V (You should be taken to the hex editor)
-Press left seven times
-The first character of the name should now be in the top left of the screen
-Press enter to edit the character
-Enter in the hex value for the character you want to change it to
(note: you can find hex values for characters in the Character Set portion
of Calcsys)
-Press left again to get to the next character
-Continue for all the characters in the name
(note: be sure you don't edit more bytes than there are characters in the name)

5) Remote Control your TI-89/92/92+
-Read remote.txt for detailed instructions on how to do this!

6) Draw Circles Fast (automatic on TI-73!)
-Go to the System Flags section of Calcsys
-Press Next (6) twelve times, so flag groups 3c through 40 are onscreen
-Choose plotflags3 (1)
-Press 4, so that there is a 1 to the right of "fastcirc"
-Press 2nd+Quit to exit back to the TIOS
-Press Graph to goto the graph screen
-Press 2nd+Draw to goto the draw menu
-Choose Circle (9)
-Choose a center point and radius point for you circle with enter
-The circle draws in four sections and much faster than normal!

7) Shift the Screen
-Goto the Port Monitor section of Calcsys
-Choose Monitor (1)
-Press right three times and up once
-You should be on port 10, aka LCD Instr
-Press Mode, and type 48
-Your screen is now shifted 8 pixels up!
-You can try other numbers from 40 to 7F to get different shifts.
(note: you can return to normal by outputting the value of 40 to
port 10, or turning your calculator off and then back on again)

8) Chat With Another Calculator
-Goto the Link Console section of Calcsys
-Connect your calculator to another TI-83+ running the Link Console
(note: you can also chat with a 82/83/85/86/89/92/92+ if it is running
some sort of chat or terminal program such as rterm or fterm)
-Type as normal
-Your input should be displayed on the other persons screen and vice versa!
(note: You may have to change the link input display settings slightly
use the X,T,(theta),n button and [on]+X,T,(theta),n button to change the
settings.  Or you could change bits 1 and 2 of asmflags3, which is where the
settings are stored)

9) Reset Your RAM
-With a low level program like Calcsys, there are numerous ways to reset
your RAM (both on purpose and by accident).  I've listed a few below:
-Output a value of 77 to port 4
-Output a value of 99 to port 6
-Do a "J 0000" in the Console
-Do a "X EE" in the Console
-Output a value of 10 to port 3 (compliments of MyFel)
-Output a value of 88 to port 7 to clear ram, and get blue lines (MyFel)
-There are many more.  Have fun trying to find as many as possible!

10) Play a Guessing Game in Hexadecimal
(note: This was a previously undocumented secret feature of Calcsys, but I
decided to document it because its just so much fun!)
-Goto the Console
-Type "SMILE"
-You have a six tries to guess a number between 0 and 63 (hexadecimal)!
